## Info

This is the example webpage written for the Web Development 1 workshop given at the UTA Central Library on August 28th.

As a reminder, HTML and CSS files can be opened in any plaintext editor or IDE (integrated development environment).

1. Download the zip file from the GitHub page or clone the directory to your local machine.
2. Extract the zip file on your local machine.
3. Right click on index.html, go to 'Open With', and click on your web browser of choice.
